# linuxdeploy-plugin-conda

Python plugin for linuxdeploy. Sets up miniconda inside an AppDir, and installs user-specified packages.


## Usage

```bash
# get linuxdeploy and linuxdeploy-plugin-conda (see below for more information)
# configure environment variables which control the plugin's behavior
> export CONDA_CHANNELS="mychannel;myotherchannel" CONDA_PACKAGES="mypackage;myotherpackage"
# call through linuxdeploy
> ./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir AppDir --plugin conda --output appimage --icon mypackage.png --desktop-file mypackage.desktop
```

There are many variables available to alter the behavior of the plugin. The current list can be obtained by calling the plugin with `--help`.


### Cross-compiling/cross-building for `i[3-6]86` (Intel 32-bit)

You can cross-build native extensions for `i[3-6]86` by installing a 32-bit compiler and instructing distutils to use those.

On Debian, Ubuntu and other derivatives:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-multilib g++-multilib
export ARCH=i386 CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" LDSHARED="gcc -m32 -shared -pthread"
```

If your system doesn't provide multilib compilers, wrappers like `i686-linux-gnu-gcc` also work fine.

**Note:** It's very important to also overwrite `LDSHARED`!

## Customize caching behavior

By default, linuxdeploy-plugin-conda redownloads the miniconda installer on every execution. This is not an issue for most people, as the installers are only 50-80 MiB in size. However, it is usually not necessary to redownload the file every time, especially while developing scripts based on the conda plugin.

Therefore, you can set a custom directory via the environment variable `$CONDA_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, into which downloaded files are stored then. The plugin makes use of some `wget` parameters to ensure that the file is only downloaded when it is incomplete (`-c`) or there is a newer version available (`-N`).

Example:

```bash
> export CONDA_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/my/own/directory
> ./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --plugin conda [...]
[...]
Using user-specified download directory: /my/own/directory
[...]
```

Relative paths work as well.



## Example

This generates a working FreeCAD AppImage from Conda ingredients, including Qt and PyQt:

```bash
wget -c "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAssassin/linuxdeploy-plugin-conda/master/linuxdeploy-plugin-conda.sh"
wget -c "https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy/releases/download/continuous/linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage"
chmod +x linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage linuxdeploy-plugin-conda.sh
